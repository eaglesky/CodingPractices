Good habbit: After coding, re-check the problem description and walk through the code 
for both normal and edge cases! Do not skip any lines of code. Think about each line
of code you write(including the return value).
For recursive functions, pay more attention to the all possible return values, including
the output parameters.

Think about a working solution first and then try optimizing it. 

When there are multiple cases and decisions, write them down to figure out the logic!

1. Be careful about the end value of iterator after the for loop!!

2. When adding/multiply two numbers digits by digits, consider the following cases:

(1) Different lengths 

(2) Last carry

(3) Null number(when number is represented as a list)

Leetcode: Add Two Numbers, Add Binary

3. Don't forget pushing the iterator forward in a loop!

4. When dealing with pointers to the linked list nodes, be careful to consider
whether they are NULL or not first.

5. For all functions that take a linked list pointer as an parameter, consider
the case when the list is NULL first;

6. Change the iterator first before "continue"

7. Be careful about the boundary check in the loop especially when it is
embedded in other loops!

8. For string related problems, always consider the case when the string is
empty!

9. When treating a digit character as a digit, make sure to convert it to an
integer first! (int d = 'c' - '0')

10. When dealing with integers, make sure to check the overflow cases(INT_MAX
and INT_MIN). And the method is to check whether the base is greater than
INT_MAX/10(and there is more digigts comming)
or not first, and then check the next digit to see if it is greater
than 7. Also be careful about the fact that |INT_MIN| = |INT_MAX| + 1, and
therefore it is possible for overflow to happen when negating an negative
number(this can be solved using unsigned int). Also for increasing number,
always be careful using the time operation on it. Try to avoid using that 
and use division instead. Another way of checking overflows is to use unsigned
int or long long type to hold the number first and then check it.

11. Carefully consider test cases outside your own algorithm!

12. Don't forget the returned value! (Write it first in a function!)

13. Anagrams refer to multiple strings(more than 1)! Leetcode : Anagrams

14. When use string.find method, remember to check the case when the target
string is not found.

15. Always remember to check the case when the vector is empty!

16. Find swapped nodes in BST(no duplicates), pay attention to the case when
the swapped nodes are neighbors.

17. Pay attention to the definition of BST:

(1)The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's
key.

(2)The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the
node's key.

(3)Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

18. Pay attention to the recursive relation of finding the depth of BST.

19. When doing recursion on binary trees, think carefully about what will
happen on the NULL child nodes.

20. DFS, pay attention to the starting position of the next recursive function
and don't forget checking visited status.

21. Be careful that string.size() is unsigned int type, so try avoid using it
to do operations with other integer and using the result as a terminal
condition.

22. When computing double number from integer, pay attention to the conversion.
Leetcode : Max Points on a line

23. For questions related to string, consider the case when the string pointer
is NULL(if it is c-string) and when the strings are empty(or part of them are
empty) (Leetcode: strstr)

24. Be careful when put the embeded "if" out when there is an "else" statement
associated with the outer "if"!
Leetcode: Simplify Path

25. When thinking about possible values of function paramters, be sure to
consider all the places where the function gets called!

26. When considering numberic string and do convertion of string to number, be
careful about the case when there are leading zeros!

27. When changing the structure of a binary tree, be careful about the child
pointers in the node, make sure they are NULL when they are not pointing
anywhere in the new tree.
Leetcode: Binary Tree Upside Down.

28. Be careful about the possible overflow cases: Negation, shifting, and all
other basic operations.

29. When iterating two array/strings at the same time, don't use the same
iterator!
Leetcode: One Edit Distance.

30. Think if a parameter is really necessary when writting a recursive function. Sometimes
we make the function return special value. 

31. Consider using hash map when searching for an element in an array.
