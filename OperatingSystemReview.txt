Operating System Review

Operating System Concepts(9th Edition)

1. Memory Management
	1.1. Memory layouts
	1.2. Segmentation and Paging

2. Processes
	2.1. General concept of process -- its definition. State, PCB, and context switch.
	2.2. Operations on processes: fork(), wait(), exec()
	2.3. Interprocess Communication -- shared memory and message passing. Motivations
	and examples. 

3. Threads.
	3.1. 

4. Process Synchronization.
	4.1. Race condition: A situation like this, where several processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place, is called a race condition.

* More threads do not mean better performance:
1. Context switch.
2. Memory usage of stacks. This also limits the number of threads you can have. In
Java, the stack size for each thread is specified by -XX:ThreadStackSize.

3. Network bandwidth could be the network after you add too many threads. Current
max network bandwidth = 10 Gbps
